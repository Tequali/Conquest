# Conquest

This was a Project i made in school while i was in my third semester.

It mainly served as a challenge on how to create a turn based combat system in Unity Engine.

The folder and 7z called Test are a build on how it could look like with simple Forms and UI to illustrate how it could look like.

Unlike the traditional turn based combat, where people dont act unless its their turn, in this proof of concept people start attacking as soon as their action bar is filled.
